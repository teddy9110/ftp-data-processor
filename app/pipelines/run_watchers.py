      Main asynchronous function to set up, initialize, and run the FTP Watcher Manager.

      This function performs the following steps:
      1. Configures basic logging for the application.
      2. Initializes an instance of `FTPWatcherManager`.
      3. Discovers and initializes all FTP watchers based on available configurations.
      4. If no watchers are found, it prints an error message and exits.
      5. If watchers are found, it prints a confirmation message.
      6. Runs all initialized watchers asynchronously.
      7. Includes error handling for any fatal exceptions that occur during the watcher execution.
