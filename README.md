# Data Reconciliation Pipeline

A Python-based data pipeline system designed for monitoring, processing, and reconciling data from multiple sources with a focus on FTP file processing and database operations.

## Project Overview

This project provides an automated system for:
- FTP file monitoring and processing
- Data reconciliation across multiple sources
- Database operations with SQLAlchemy
- Asynchronous processing capabilities
- Docker containerization support

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13.2
- UV package manager
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

## Dependencies

Main dependencies:
- alembic
- SQLAlchemy
- pandas
- numpy
- PyYAML
- requests

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```shell script
git clone [repository-url]
```


2. Install dependencies:
```shell script
uv install
```


## Configuration

The project uses various configuration files:
- `alembic.ini` - Database migration configuration
- `pytest.ini` - Test configuration
- `mypy.ini` - Type checking configuration

## Development Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```shell script
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Unix
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```


2. Install development dependencies:
```shell script
uv install
```


## Database Management

Run migrations:
```shell script
alembic upgrade head
```


Create new migration:
```shell script
alembic revision -m "description"
```


## Testing

Run the test suite:
```shell script
pytest
```


## Docker Support

Build the application:
```shell script
docker build -t reconciliation-pipeline .
```


## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitLab CI/CD with configurations in `.gitlab-ci.yml` for:
- Automated testing
- Code quality checks
- Deployment pipelines

## Development Guidelines

1. Use type hints consistently
2. Follow project structure for new features
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Use UV for package management
5. Run linting and type checking before commits

## Monitoring and Logging

The application includes built-in monitoring for:
- FTP file processing status
- Data reconciliation results
- Processing errors and exceptions

## Deployment

1. Configure environment variables
2. Run database migrations
3. Deploy using Docker or direct installation
4. Monitor logs for processing status

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit a pull request
4. Ensure tests pass
5. Follow coding standards
